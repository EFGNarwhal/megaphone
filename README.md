# megaphone
a discord bot that allows you to send a message from one channel to another

this bot's main purpose is to be able to send messages from anywhere within a server to another channel through the bot. originally used for anonymity purposes. i thought someone else might need it for this extremely niche purpose, or some other creative reason.

!send <#channel-name> <message>: sends a message to that channel from the megaphone bot

!ping: pings the bot

!info: credits me (Narwhal#9999)

!help: shows this help message
